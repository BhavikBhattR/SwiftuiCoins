######Crypto updates app where user can get live crypto coins price

##Things which were taken care while making this project

###### This is an ios app made in swiftUI. Where user can get live data of the prices for crypto coins.  
###### Apart from that it is made sure that data between screens are in sync and it was achieved by right uses of publishers and subscribers
###### It is made sure that all the view models of the screens, in their methods have weak reference on class so that the user's RAM is used efficiently
###### Also to make sure that app can be user friendly in both the dark and light mode, custom color sets are used
###### It doesn't have original payment gateway to buy official coins but as app was made for learning purposes using core data, feature of byuing coins locally was added.
